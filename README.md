# Calendar
This python program is used to generate a .ics file of your course chedule from Sustech, which can be used to automatically import into your smartphone's Calendar App

1. Downloading main.py file into your computer

2. Downloading the Course schedule from tis system of Sustech, put the file under the same path from main.py, and rename it as '学期课表.xlsx'

3. Run the python program and you will get a MyCalendar.ics file from the same path. 

4. Use any ways you can to copy it to your phone, here take my iphone as an example. It's quite complicated because it's iOS, I believe it will be easier on Android devices:

   If your iOS version is less than iOS 16, then you can use your personal email to send an email with the ics file to your campus account, by opening ics file in your mail App you can add all of them in your Calendar App, unfortunately iOS 16 just cut the button and by doing this you can just add them one by one :(

    However, if you happen to have an iPad or Mac, or you know someone who also has Apple devices, you can let him AirDrop the file to you and it will automatically import the schedule.
